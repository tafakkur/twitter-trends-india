# twitter-trends-india
Hourly collection of twitter trends for major Indian cities since April 2020.

The folder <code>___Apr 2020 to Jun 2021</code> contains one file per city.

### From 13th July, 2021
The other folders update hourly, the number after the bar refers to the city/location's WOEID.
Please note that there maybe duplicate file names across folders, hence be careful while dumping all the files in a single folder.
